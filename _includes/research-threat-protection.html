    <p>Design of improved ballistic protection systems can be aided significantly with computational simulations. Simulations allow for efficient scanning of a wide design space as well as a broad range of impact scenarios. They also allow assessment of the efficacy of multi-layered multi-material systems. But the fidelity of computed outcomes is predicated on the use of high-fidelity models of material deformation, comminution and fracture under very high strain rates. The goal of our research program has been to advance the understanding of damage and failure modes in armor ceramics and cermets as well as the deformation response of high-performance fiber-reinforced polymer composites. To this end, we have devised and executed experiments that allow for critical assessments of the predictive capabilities of existing and new emerging constitutive models.</p>
